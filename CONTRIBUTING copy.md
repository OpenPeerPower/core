# Contributing to Open Peer Power

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Open Peer Power. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [openpeerpower.io](https://openpeerpower.io/)? If you are a developer and have devices in your home which aren't working with Open Peer Power yet, why not spend a couple of hours and help to integrate them?

The process is straight-forward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by Kubernetes (but skip step 0 and 1)
 - Fork the Open Peer Power [git repository](https://github.com/openpeerpower/core).
 - Write the code for your device, notification service, sensor, or IoT thing.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/openpeerpower/core/tree/dev) branch of Open Peer Power.

Still interested? Then you should take a peek at the [developer documentation](https://developers.openpeerpower.io/) to get more details.
