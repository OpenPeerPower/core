"""Test the stream worker corner cases.

Exercise the stream worker functionality by mocking av.open calls to return a
fake media container as well a fake decoded stream in the form of a series of
packets. This is needed as some of these cases can't be encoded using pyav.  It
is preferred to use test_hls.py for example, when possible.

The worker opens the stream source (typically a URL) and gets back a
container that has audio/video streams. The worker iterates over the sequence
of packets and sends them to the appropriate output buffers. Each test
creates a packet sequence, with a mocked output buffer to capture the segments
pushed to the output streams. The packet sequence can be used to exercise
failure modes or corner cases like how out of order packets are handled.
