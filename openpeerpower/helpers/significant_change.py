"""Helpers to help find if an entity has changed significantly.

Does this with help of the integration. Looks at significant_change.py
platform for a function `async_check_significant_change`:

```python
from typing import Optional
from openpeerpower.core import OpenPeerPower

async def async_check_significant_change(
    opp: OpenPeerPower,
    old_state: str,
    old_attrs: dict,
    new_state: str,
    new_attrs: dict,
    **kwargs,
) -> Optional[bool]
```

Return boolean to indicate if significantly changed. If don't know, return None.

**kwargs will allow us to expand this feature in the future, like passing in a
level of significance.

The following cases will never be passed to your function:
- if either state is unknown/unavailable
- state adding/removing
