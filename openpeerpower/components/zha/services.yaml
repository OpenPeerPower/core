warning_device_squawk:
  description: >-
    This service uses the WD capabilities to emit a quick audible/visible pulse called a "squawk". The squawk command has no effect if the WD is currently active (warning in progress).
  fields:
    ieee:
      description: IEEE address for the device
      example: "00:0d:6f:00:05:7d:2d:34"
    mode:
      description: >-
        The Squawk Mode field is used as a 4-bit enumeration, and can have one of the values shown in Table 8-24 of the ZCL spec - Squawk Mode Field. The exact operation of each mode (how the WD “squawks”) is implementation specific.
      example: 1
    strobe:
      description: >-
        The strobe field is used as a Boolean, and determines if the visual indication is also required in addition to the audible squawk, as shown in Table 8-25 of the ZCL spec - Strobe Bit.
      example: 1
    level:
      description: >-
        The squawk level field is used as a 2-bit enumeration, and determines the intensity of audible squawk sound as shown in Table 8-26 of the ZCL spec - Squawk Level Field Values.
      example: 2

warning_device_warn:
  description: >-
    This service starts the WD operation. The WD alerts the surrounding area by audible (siren) and visual (strobe) signals.
  fields:
    ieee:
      description: IEEE address for the device
      example: "00:0d:6f:00:05:7d:2d:34"
    mode:
      description: >-
        The Warning Mode field is used as an 4-bit enumeration, can have one of the values 0-6 defined below in table 8-20 of the ZCL spec. The exact behavior of the WD device in each mode is according to the relevant security standards.
      example: 1
    strobe:
      description: >-
        The Strobe field is used as a 2-bit enumeration, and determines if the visual indication is required in addition to the audible siren, as indicated in Table 8-21 of the ZCL spec. "0" means no strobe, "1" means strobe. If the strobe field is “1” and the Warning Mode is “0” (“Stop”) then only the strobe is activated.
      example: 1
    level:
      description: >-
        The Siren Level field is used as a 2-bit enumeration, and indicates the intensity of audible squawk sound as shown in Table 8-22 of the ZCL spec.
      example: 2
    duration:
      description: >-
        Requested duration of warning, in seconds (16 bit). If both Strobe and Warning Mode are "0" this field SHALL be ignored.
      example: 2
    duty_cycle:
      description: >-
        Indicates the length of the flash cycle. This provides a means of varying the flash duration for different alarm types (e.g., fire, police, burglar). Valid range is 0-100 in increments of 10. All other values SHALL be rounded to the nearest valid value. Strobe SHALL calculate duty cycle over a duration of one second. The ON state SHALL precede the OFF state. For example, if Strobe Duty Cycle Field specifies “40,” then the strobe SHALL flash ON for 4/10ths of a second and then turn OFF for 6/10ths of a second.
      example: 50
    intensity:
      description: >-
        Indicates the intensity of the strobe as shown in Table 8-23 of the ZCL spec. This attribute is designed to vary the output of the strobe (i.e., brightness) and not its frequency, which is detailed in section 8.4.2.3.1.6 of the ZCL spec.
      example: 2
