    """Create forwarded middleware for the app.

    Process IP addresses, proto and host information in the forwarded for headers.

    `X-Forwarded-For: <client>, <proxy1>, <proxy2>`
    e.g., `X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.195, 70.41.3.18, 150.172.238.178`

    We go through the list from the right side, and skip all entries that are in our
    trusted proxies list. The first non-trusted IP is used as the client IP. If all
    items in the X-Forwarded-For are trusted, including the most left item (client),
    the most left item is used. In the latter case, the client connection originated
    from an IP that is also listed as a trusted proxy IP or network.

    `X-Forwarded-Proto: <client>, <proxy1>, <proxy2>`
    e.g., `X-Forwarded-Proto: https, http, http`
    OR `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` (one entry, even with multiple proxies)

    The X-Forwarded-Proto is determined based on the corresponding entry of the
    X-Forwarded-For header that is used/chosen as the client IP. However,
    some proxies, for example, Kubernetes NGINX ingress, only retain one element
    in the X-Forwarded-Proto header. In that case, we'll just use what we have.

    `X-Forwarded-Host: <host>`
    e.g., `X-Forwarded-Host: example.com`

    If the previous headers are processed successfully, and the X-Forwarded-Host is
    present, it will be used.

    Additionally:
      - If no X-Forwarded-For header is found, the processing of all headers is skipped.
      - Log a warning when untrusted connected peer provides X-Forwarded-For headers.
      - If multiple instances of X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Proto or
        X-Forwarded-Host are found, an HTTP 400 status code is thrown.
      - If malformed or invalid (IP) data in X-Forwarded-For header is found,
        an HTTP 400 status code is thrown.
      - The connected client peer on the socket of the incoming connection,
        must be trusted for any processing to take place.
      - If the number of elements in X-Forwarded-Proto does not equal 1 or
        is equal to the number of elements in X-Forwarded-For, an HTTP 400
        status code is thrown.
      - If an empty X-Forwarded-Host is provided, an HTTP 400 status code is thrown.
      - If an empty X-Forwarded-Proto is provided, or an empty element in the list,
        an HTTP 400 status code is thrown.
